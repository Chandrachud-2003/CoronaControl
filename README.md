# Welcome to CoronaControl!

In the month of April, I was assigned to make an advanced Covid-19 Survey app for a Governmental NGO - The Foundation for Quality Control India. 
The app was mainly to crowdsource (early during the pandemic) possible trends of Covid-19 symptoms in India for reference for medical staff and doctors 
currently assigned with tackline the virus. The survey involved over 15 detailed questions presented in a clean, modern UI/UX design, and implemented a 
unique algorithm to assign an individual score to each person/family taking the survey. Keeping in mind that it is impossible (simply from an app) to determine 
with substantial proximity the probability of a person to be in risk of the virus, the algorithm employed an uncertainty factor/percentage while 
calculating the risk percent for each user/family surveyed. Although the app was not released to the Play Store due to strict monitoring over the types 
of Apps related to Covid-19 that can be uploaded to the Google Play Store (since the Government of India already had an App directly from the Central Government, a
t the time), the App was not released to Play Store, but was instead employed in FQI affiliated hospitals where doctors and nurses survey patients contact-free 
and gather and analyze data to identify variations and trends of patients coming to their hospital.

The app was designed in Android Studio and programmed with Java, Kotlin and JavaScript on the backend, while XML was used for the Front-End UI/UX Design. 
For storage of data a database structure was designed on the Google Firebase platform and implemented within the app.
